tmdb-java
============

A Java wrapper around the [TMDb v3 API][1] and a simple DSL for easy
interaction, based upon [JakeWharton/trakt-java/][2].

Remote services are grouped into local service objects which can be centrally
managed by a `ServiceManager` instance. The manager will act as a factory for
all of the services and will automatically initialize them with your
credentials and API key.

Each service contains methods which correspond to a remote method. Each of
these methods instantiates a class that will allow for you to build the
parameters using the Java builder pattern.

Required remote method parameters will be arguments to the service method and
all of the methods in the returned builder are optional.

When fully assembled, you can trigger the remote execution by calling the
`fire()` method. This will return a native object which represents the result
of the execution. All returned objects are immutable and should be handled
as such.

The overall package and class layout as well as most of the code
originates from JakeWharton/trakt-java/.
